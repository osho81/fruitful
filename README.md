# Fruitful

## Outline and Rules
Candy crush like game, with fruits and with slightly different rules:   

* Each move (from one square to another square) cost 5 points.   
* 3 fruits in a row gives 3points, 4 in a row gives 12 points, and 5 in a row gives 25 points.    
* Game time is limited (time elapsed and time left is visualized as a progressing bar).   

Since each move costs points, strategy is needed for highest possible points within the game time.
