# fruitful
Candy crush like game, with fruits and with slightly different rules:   

a) each move (from one square to another) cost 5 points.   
b) 3 fruits in a row gives 3points, 4 in a row gives 12 points, and 5 in a row gives 25 points.    
c) game time is limite (time elapsed and left is visualized a progressing bar).   

Since each move costs points, strategy is needed for highest possible points within the game time. 

Made by vanilla javascript - no library or framework used for mobile-friendly design. 

Purpose: strengthen javascript skills; create a simple fun game with different rules than similar games.
